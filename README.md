# AekiSales

PART 1: STATEMENT

A big superstore retailer called AEKI is in crisis. Their sales for the last few years have been really bad and they have asked us for help trying to understand what is wrong with their numbers, or even better, what was good a few years ago.

Their glory days were back between 2014 and 2017. The company has delivered us an Excel file containing all the sales they did during that period. As you will see, the Excel file has a lot of interesting information about the products sold (including a product hierarchy), the location of the stores where it was sold, how much money they made and the discounts they applied.

The company has never really analyzed this information before, and they expect us to do a good job about it. In general terms, they expect us to create a full report analyzing their sales, providing detailed information about what we see, combining powerful charts and useful explanations (and even suggestions!).

It is VERY important that we take a close look at the data and understand every field they have included, both the qualitative and the quantitative ones. Make sure to do that before starting any analysis. You may or may not use them all.

Our boss, with wide experience in this kind of tasks but also a very busy man, has been taking a quick look at the data and has provided some insights about the information that we should provide to our customer. I will just show you his e-mail and I'm sure it will help you understand what is expected from us:

Hey man, what's up? I've been on the phone with the AEKI Sales Manager and he's pretty upset, so I'm going to try to help you guys with the analysis. I'm going to give you all the freedom you need to create an excellent PDF report, but here are some guidelines and general ideas I need you to follow:

1. The guy is very concerned about manual mistakes in the Excel file. Can you explore the data and identify suspicious values? Apparently some folks entered values manually and made several mistakes... let's make sure we identify them and collect them in an independent report or something. Of course, leave them out of the rest of the analyses we prepare.

2. He has also explicitly asked me for a new report with the average, maximum and minimum price at which they have sold each of their products every year. Can you please work on that? Maybe if you can, additionally, plot that somehow, it would be nice.

3. Analyze time trends. Do we have better and worse seasons? Did the company sell more or less as years went by?

4. Can you provide a compelling report about the sales that were returned?  That's always bad news, you know. You have a list of those in the sheet "Returns". Surprise me...

5. I'm adding some geographic information. I would like you to cross it with the sales data. Is there any relationship between the population or the surface of each State and the sales or the profit? Can you detect any States with a better room for improvement? That would really help...

Whatever you guys provide to AEKI, please make sure to follow the following directions or I swear these guys will kill me:

Be creative, original and make sure the presentation is good.
What I'm sharing in this mail are just some initial thoughts. Please go WAY deeper than that.
Create USEFUL insights.
Combine beautiful plots, new data frames and EXPLANATIONS of what you see.
Quality over quantity!
Hope to hear back from you soon!!

PS. I have the feeling that there are pieces of information missing in this data. Please look at it carefully and let me know if we need to request any additional data.



Well, I think this e-mail speaks by itself, doesn't it? The boss wants us to be creative while we make sure that we provide a relevant number of analytical perspectives that make sense to the customer. I can think of some questions we should try to answer, but please don't stick to these only, these are just some ideas I'm having right now:

Is my boss right? Is all data from AEKI sales in the attached file? What about the mistakes? I'm worried. Please let me know if you need more data as soon as possible (this should be your first step I think, e-mail me as soon as you have something).
What is the relationship between the discounts applied and the profit achieved?
Which are the products and product categories / subcategories in which we applied more discount in relative and in absolute values?
I guess the most sold products are the cheapest ones but let's take a look.
Which discounts are most commonly applied?
Which products, categories and/or subcategories have a worse sales VS discount ratio?
Again, these are just some ideas, make sure to give me elaborate answers to all of them but help me create a complete, thorough report with more questions and answers exploring all the different fields we have on the data they've shared with us.

The file attached cannot be modified in any way and must be loaded in R as-is. All calculations and data manipulation that you need to do must be performed in R.
Do this project in groups of 4 people. If you have any issues with this let the teacher know.
Two deliverables are expected: a pdf report (using R Markdown) and all the R code used properly structured and commented.
Contact the teachers as soon as you need them (missing information, questions and so on). They are there to help.
Timings:
